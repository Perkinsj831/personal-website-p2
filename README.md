# personal-website-p1

This is my first project learning to code. I created a personal website about myself. I wanted to put the knowledge I've learned so far and captivate it in a website.

If you click the home page it will give a breif description about my journey into the coding world with a memorable quote.

Next if you click the about me page. It will give you some hobbies I like to do when I am not coding.

Lastly, if you go to the portfolio page it will show you a list of projects I have completed since I started coding.

I used some basic CSS and html to help format this website. I ran into a few problems resizing pictures but I was able to sort that out.
